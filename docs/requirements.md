# Requirements

- The project is programmed using Python programming language. Python is my main language of choice so I would like to peer review projects that are also coded with Python.

- The program is a desktop application that takes MIDI as input data and generates similar sequences using the Markov chain algorithm and utilizing the trie datastructure to optimize memory usage. No speficic target for time-complexity of the program.

- I'm a musician and a student on the CS bachelor program in the University of Helsinki, thus building a generative MIDI tool felt naturally interesting to me.

- As sources I'm going to be using [this GeeksforGeeks article on Markov Chain](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/markov-chain/), [Wikipedia article on the trie datastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) and YouTube videos on the subject.

- The documentation and code of this program will be written in English.
