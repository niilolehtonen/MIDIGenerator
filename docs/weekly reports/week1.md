## Week 1

This week I initializes a Github repository for the project and chose the subject for my project. I spent some time getting familiar with the algorithms and datastructures I'm going to be using and also installed some libraries that could be utilized in the project such as music21.

Things I learned:
- What is the Markov Chain algorithm
- What is a trie data structure

The two challenges with the project at the moment:
- How can I get the MIDI data to communicate with the algorithm.
- What algorithm am I going to be using to generate the length of the midi notes.

### Next steps:
Start implementing the algorithms into python code & figuring out how to connect them with MIDI-information.
